# Code of Conduct

## Using Git

1. No direct pushing to main.
2. All new code for pull requests MUST go through the dev branch first.
3. Create a branch per task/feature.
4. Pull Requests - Only make pull requests through Git Hub.
    - Do not use `git merge` in your local repository to do pull requests. `git merge` should only be used for updating your local branch with the latest updates from the `dev branch` : `git pull origin dev`

## GitHub Project

1. Create a branch per task/feature to track progress.
2. For every branch/feature/task, add an issue to the repository.
3. Before we start a task in TODO, ensure your task in In Progress is completed.
4. Use tags to assist with prioritization

## Styling

1. Use camelCase for variables and functions/methods

```
superLongExampleThatNeverEnds
```

2. Use UpperCamelCase for Classes

```
SuperSimpleClassNameExampleButNotReally
```

3. Use Es6 imports -`import variable from "../../../file-path.js"`
    - If a module does not provide an equivalent for es6, reach out to the group for assistance
