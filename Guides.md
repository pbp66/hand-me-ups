# Guide for a Successful Project

## Using Git

1. `git pull` // This will pull only from the branch you are working on
2. `git push` // Push code to github on same branch. Same as `git push origin` or `git push origin <branch-name>`
3. `git fetch origin dev` `git merge` // merge the `dev` branch with your local branch
4. `git pull origin dev` // same as above but much shorter
5. Ensure you are using `git push -u origin <branch-name>` after making a new branch
